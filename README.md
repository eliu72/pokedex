# üåº Pok√©dex
### Gotta catch 'em all!

Want to access all your favourite Pok√©mon in one place? Look no further!

for easy and aestetically pleasing viewing.

## üìñ Getting Started
If you don't already use poetry for python package maangement:
```pip install poetry```

Install Dependencies:
```poetry install```

Populate your Notion Database
1. Follow the instructions at https://developers.notion.com/docs to create an integration.
2. Create a secrets.py file in the pokedex folder.
3. On the first line, store your notion integration key by writing ```KEY="<your-notion-integration-key>"```
4. On the next line, write ```DATABASE_ID="<database_id>"```
5. In the root of your repository, run the command ```poetry run python pokedex/NotionSync.py```

Finally, watch your database populate!

## üéè Customizing your Database
To customize your database, you can pass in a list of Pok√©mon names or ids to the Pokedex() function in NotionSync.py.

Please note that you can only make 500 API calls at once so this program has limited the default to retrieving 100 Pokemon. You can retrieve additional Pokemon by changing the parameters in the range() function in the get_all_pokemon function.
